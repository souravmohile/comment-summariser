This is where I will add general thoughts about this project.

The main idea was that for a live video, we have a summary and score for the comments, 
which is tied to the timemline of the video.

Now while working on this project I have been hit with some questions that will define the approach
that we will take to build this project.

1. Will this system work only on live videos? or will it also work for uploaded full vids?
    - The scope started off with the idea of live vidoes but then again having this system for
    non live videos also sounds nice.
    - So there will be mainly 3 types: Live videos that are ongoing, Live videos that have eneded, 
    Normal videos.
2. What platform is this aimed towards? 
    - If youtube, the comments are relatively straightforward to work with and will be dealt with
    easily by out of the box language models.
    - Although if I am a platform like Twitch, the comments contain a lot of niche lingo and this
    lingo keeps changing through out time. This would cause an issue for out of the box models,
    but could be handled through prompting/rag/finetuning. 
    - Continual training of models or prompt update sounds fun to work with.
3. How will I source my data?
    - Will I be able to manage everything through twitch/youtube APIs without upsetting the rate 
    limit gods?
    - Will I need to scrape data? 
    - Where will this be stored? I was planning to use kafka to store this data temporarily 
    just for processing and then once the livestream ends the data is deleted, or if its a video, 
    the summary and score data stays?
4. What will be my frontend? 
    - Currently a simple frontend has been made on streamlit, and although I can use streamlit to 
    build a backend as well, I would rather use FastAPI.

My plan:
The next step I want to take is to deal with the data fetching pipeline. I want to get data, live or not, 
from some source and then send it intervally to my processor.

I will do this for live videos on youtube for now, later we can update it for twitch.

If the livestream is ongoing, we will use youtube API
If the livestream has ended, we will use pytchat

1: Get youtube video link
2: Figure out type of video and direct to the appropriate code

Right so theres a blip-
I can retrieve chat for live ongoing twitch videos but the thing is that I cannot access chat for the 
ended VODs so now in our system we will just say that we can store this so when the video is playing back we 
access the stored summmary etc.. but like....

1. Get the live comments for an ongoing video from the twitch IRC
2. Work on the backend part of processing
3. Worry about the video and frontend later

when you put this project on github for the portfolio make sure that you also show results of the
finetuned vs non finetuned model so that the effect of your finetuning is shown in the project.

ive spent the day learning about asyncio and websockets... will take more hands on work with this but 
i seem to get the idea behind it... gonna nab the code from the documentation for websockets
